### <p align= centre>Truly something MARVEL-ous</p>  


Selection Week at MARVEL. It came right out of the blue and completely swept me away, a part of college that will make it into my list of vivid memories.   
**MARVEL** is the foresight that VISION UVCE is opening into the worlds of future students. A student-led research and development center, it's a budding centre for cutting-edge projects and ideation. In less than a year, it's become a brand identity within UVCE, admired by students as well as alumni, who frequently show up and tinker with projects happening in the lab.  
Selection week, the final hurdle for co-ordinators to be has one idea in mind: a complete experience of being in the inside crowd at marvel, within a week. 10 tasks are given to everyone, some compulsory, some not, some teamed, some- not as much, but each of them catered to a unique facet of life as a co-ordinator.  
The very first task is an individual project, to drill in the fact that being a coordinator _in no way means you can stop your own learning process_. Other tasks included were cataloguing equipments in daily use, - maintaining bills, - making promotional content, and creating project ideas for a new batch of students.  
All of this was a very different learning for each of the hopefuls, something unlike anything else. In the relaxed,productive environment of the lab, with co-ordinator buddies always available to help out, and students mingling and nudging each other along.  
To me, MARVEL is an example of how much difference the sheer force of will behind a good idea can make. And how, in a cut-throat world, creating an approachable, hospitable environment for everyone is a very different feeling, something that fills me with faith that MARVEL will be in a legacy in its own.  
  
  Life changing things needn't always be grand gestures, i guess.
